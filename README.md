## Hassan Toor - Portfolio Site
I'm a software developer with experience across the full stack.  On the front end, this includes JavaScript, React, and Redux. On the backend, I've built projects with Node + Express, and Ruby on Rails.  I have experience with both SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. I have a deep passion for problem-solving, learning, and creating. Above all, I'm always looking to improve. Currently based in New York, but open to relocating for the right opportunity. <hassantoor8@gmail.com>
